    "where we think that $f_{j} = f(x_{j})$, which is to say, we think the data comes from a function $f(x)$, but we do not know the function $f(x)$.  Note, each point $x_{j}$ is called a _node_.  The question becomes, how might we find an approximation to $f(x)$?  As it turns out, there are an infinite number of ways to solve this problem, each with good and bad features.  The approach we will study first is called _Lagrange Interpolation_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This method starts by deciding we are going to fit the data with an $n^{th}$ order polynomial, i.e. we choose a polynomial $P_{n}(x)$ of the form \n",

Thus, we see that in principle we should be able to determine $P_{n}(x)$.  The advantage of having $P_{n}(x)$ is that anything else we want to know about $f(x)$, such as $f'(x)$ or $\\int f(x)dx$, we can find by using $P_{n}(x)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is another important way to think about $P_{n}(x)$.  While it is _completely equivalent_ to what we have described above, it forms a very fundamental way to think about interpolation that comes up again and again in applied mathematics and numerical analysis.  In this approach, we write $P_{n}(x)$ as \n",

    "We can motivate this result by looking at simple cases and working our way up.  So, suppose we let $n=1$.  In this case, we need to find two linear functions $L^{(1)}_{0}(x)$ and $L^{(1)}_{1}(x)$.  As we can readily see, in order to satisfy our requirements for these functions, we can just use\n",
